# CodeFresh CrossPlane Provider

## Description
This is a boilerplate contribution for developing a CrossPlane provider for the CodeFresh CI/CD Platform. It includes a generic CodeFresh client for CRUD operations on different resources and a basic project CRD and controller with unit testing for the observe method.


## Setup

(TODO: Add specific setup instructions, including environment requirements, installation steps, and any configuration needed.)

## How to Use

Examples of how to use the provider will be included, demonstrating how to manage CodeFresh resources through CrossPlane custom resources. (TODO: Add specific examples and usage instructions).

## Development

Contributions to the provider are welcome! (TODO: Provide instructions on how to set up a development environment, run tests, and contribute code.)

## Code of Conduct
This project adheres to a code of conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. (TODO: Provide a link to the full code of conduct.)

# TODO
-  Enhance the CodeFresh client with more features.
-  Expand the unit tests to cover more methods.
-  Add support for additional CodeFresh resources.
-  Provide detailed documentation and examples.


This README serves as a starting point and will be updated as the project evolves.
